# 🔥 Smart IoT Fire and Gas Detector System:

An IoT-based hazard monitoring system built with an ESP32 microcontroller to detect fire and gas leaks. The system sends real-time alerts through the **Blynk IoT app** and provides on-site warnings using LEDs and a buzzer.

> Developed as a course project for **SWE 466 – Embedded Systems & IoT Lab** at **Metropolitan University, Sylhet**.

## 📌 Project Goals:

- Monitor fire and gas levels in real time.
- Notify users remotely via Blynk mobile app.
- Activate local alarms using a buzzer and LED indicators.
- Deliver an affordable and expandable safety solution.

## 🛠️ Hardware Used:

| Component         | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ESP32            | Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller          |
| MQ2 Sensor       | Detects smoke, LPG, and methane gases  |
| Flame Sensor     | Detects infrared light from fire       |
| LEDs             | Red (Danger), Yellow (Warning), Green (Safe) |
| Buzzer           | Emits sound when fire/gas is detected  |
| Breadboard & Wires | Used for prototyping connections      |
| USB Cable/Battery| Power supply for ESP32                 |

## 🧠 Features:

- 🔥 Dual Hazard Detection: Flame and gas.
- 📲 Real-Time Alerts: Notifications through Blynk IoT.
- 🔊 Visual + Audio Alerts: LEDs and buzzer for local warning.
- 📶 Wi-Fi Enabled: ESP32 handles cloud communication.

---

## 🧪 System Workflow:

1. Sensors (MQ2 + Flame) monitor the environment.
2. Sensor readings are sent to the ESP32.
3. If a fire or high gas concentration is detected:
   - LEDs change to red or yellow.
   - The buzzer activates.
   - A mobile alert is pushed via the Blynk app.
4. If conditions are safe, the green LED remains on.

## 📲 Blynk Integration:

| Virtual Pin | Function         |
|-------------|------------------|
| V1          | Smoke level (%)  |
| V2          | Flame status     |
| V3          | Alert toggle     |

- BlynkTimer is used for non-blocking operations.
- The app UI displays sensor status and triggers push alerts.
